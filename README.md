# -Android-Sound_Analysis_and_visualization

Hello, I am Wang, a master student in tohoku university (Japan Sendai). 
  
My research topic is about sound analysis and visualization, and in this project, I will share all the knowledge that I have learned and all the demos I have made during my master-degree study.   
  
Feel free to use them if they can help.

This project contains several small demos, from the most basic sound recording algorithm to sound propagation simulation. I will introduce them one by one.  

Demo 1: Sound recording.  
    Demo1 is the first step of the whole system, in this part, I will create a simple sound recording application in android platform. And to do this, there are two things that need me to do. The first one is permission requirements for the use of microphone, and the second one is use the microphone to collect the sound data.
